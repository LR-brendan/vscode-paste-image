# LR-brendan edit

Modified so absolute paths get converted to a remote uri. (previously the ext tried to save absolute paths to local file system - which may not exist)

# Paste Image

Paste image directly from clipboard to markdown/asciidoc(or other file)!

**Support Mac/Windows/Linux!** And support config destination folder.

![paste-image](./res/vscode-paste-image.gif)

Now you can enable `pasteImage.showFilePathConfirmInputBox` to modify file path before save:

![confirm-inputbox](./res/confirm-inputbox.png)

## Usage

1. capture screen to clipboard
2. Open the command palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
3. Type: "Paste Image" or you can use default keyboard binding: `Ctrl+Alt+V` (`Cmd+Alt+V` on Mac).
4. Image will be saved in the folder that contains current editing file
5. The relative path will be paste to current editing file 

## Config

- `pasteImage.defaultName`

    The default image file name.

    The value of this config will be pass to the 'format' function of moment library(a js time manipulation library), you can read document https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/ for advanced usage.

    And you can use variable:

    - `${currentFileName}`: the current file name with ext.
    - `${currentFileNameWithoutExt}`: the current file name without ext.

    Default value is `Y-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss`.

- `pasteImage.path`

    The destination to save image file.
    
    You can use variable:
    
    - `${currentFileDir}`: the path of directory that contain current editing file. 
    - `${projectRoot}`: the path of the project opened in vscode.
    - `${fileBasename}`: the current file name with ext.
    - `${fileBasenameNoExtension}`: the current file name without ext.

    Default value is `./`.

- `pasteImage.showFilePathConfirmInputBox`

    Enabling this `boolean` setting will make Paste Image ask you to confirm the file path(or file name). This is useful if you want to change the file path of the image you are currently pasting. Default is `false`.

## Format

### File name format

If you selected some text in editor, then extension will use it as the image file name. **The selected text can be a sub path like `subFolder/subFolder2/nameYouWant`.**

If not the image will be saved in this format: "Y-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss.png". You can config default image file name by `pasteImage.defaultName`.

### File link format

When you editing a markdown, it will pasted as markdown image link format `![](imagePath)`.

When you editing a asciidoc, it will pasted as asciidoc image link format `image::imagePath[]`.

In other file, it just paste the image's path.
